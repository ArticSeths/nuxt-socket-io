# nuxt-socket-io

> Nuxt with basic socket.io examples

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm run install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev:server

Note: `npm run dev` will just run nuxt (you'd have to implement the io server separately and remember to allow the client's origin. Explanation coming)

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
